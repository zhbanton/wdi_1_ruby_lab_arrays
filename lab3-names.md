# Lab 3: Joke-Explainer Jones

I had a friend in college who tended to accumulate nicknames. Here's what his "name" looked like after a couple weeks:

```
name = "sean ian michael segfault bartholomew joke-explainer jones"
```

Your objective is to transform this string into the string `"Sean Ian Michael Segfault Joke-explainer Jones"`. You'll need to do four things:

* Split the name into an array of words
* Remove the word "bartholomew" (I guess he didn't like it)
* Capitalize each word
* Join the words back into a string, separated by spaces

As with the previous lab, you may want to use some intermediate variables, but it's possible to make this a one-liner.

## Extra Challenge

Capitalize the "explainer" in "Joke-explainer", without hard-coding that string anywhere in your program (i.e. your program should still work if Sean had other hyphenated nicknames).
